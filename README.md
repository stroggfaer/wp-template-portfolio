> A well-commented blank Wordpress theme.

This blank WordPress theme is great for people who want to learn how to develop themes. The Naked WordPress theme is commented in-line so that as you’re building your WordPress theme, you understand what’s actually going on.

It’s like a WordPress tutorial + starter theme combined!

This theme includes all the basic units for a client site:
- home page
- about page
- info page
- blog page
- etc.

Comments are included on each and every piece of the WordPress puzzle, so you can move things around intelligently, or remove them without worry.

### Who this is for

- Designers who want to _design_ a WordPress theme, not build it
- Designers familiar with HTML and CSS
- Anyone _not_ familiar with the quirks of WordPress PHP
- Developers who want guidance on the structure and application of WordPress functions

### Installation

Download the [zipped theme source](https://github.com/andjosh/naked-wordpress/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and upload it to your WordPress `/themes` directory.
